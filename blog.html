        <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
        <p>The most challenging part of this assignment was both figuring out how to add an image to the webpage, and getting picture of myself that I wanted other people to see... Though, they didn't take too long all things considered, I just had to quikly look up how to add a photo to html, and I was pretty much set. As for what I learned and what I already knew I'd say I knew most of the html stuff (aside from the image), but I didn't have *any* prior experience with git, so it was pretty fun learning how to use it effectively. And for the resources, I guess w3schools and my notes from lecture were all I really needed. It wasn't that difficult of an assignment thankfully.</p>
